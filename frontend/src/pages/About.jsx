            Born from a rogue food pod in the Orion Belt, AstroBite was the universe’s first fast food chain
            to bring flavor faster than light. We serve burgers that make Martians cry and fries that float
            in zero-G. Whether you’re on Earth or orbiting Saturn, your taste buds are about to launch.
